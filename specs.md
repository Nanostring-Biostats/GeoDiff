2. Given a GeoMx S4 object, fitPoisthNorm_sp runs the Poisson model-based normalization and log2 transformation on each element in "groupvar" individually. As such, the results for a given grouping/facet of the data should match the fitPoisthNorm results when an object is subset down to a single slide. Specifically, the following should be true:  
test:  
  2.1) For a given element in groupvar, the corresponding column in the "threshold0" matrix, which is within featureData, should be identical to the single-patient case's fetureData's para0[,n+1]th column.  
  2.2) For a given element in groupvar, the corresponding column in the "threshold" matrix, which is within featureData, should be identical to the single-patient case's fetureData's para[,n+1]th column.  
  2.3) For a given element in groupvar, the normalized matrix "normmat0_sp", in the assayData slot, should be identical to that element's "normmat0" matrix, also in the assayData slot, for all samples within that element. In other words, the matrix within the "single slide" results (normmat0) should be a subset of the "multiple slide" results (normmat_sp).  
  2.4) For a given element in groupvar, the normaized matrix "normmat_sp", in the assayData slot, should be identical to that element's "normmat" matrix, also in the assayData slot, for all samples within that element. In other words, the matrix within the "single slide" results (normmat) should be a subset of the "multiple slide" results (normmat_sp).  
  2.5) For a given element in groupvar, the vector of sizefact, located in phenoData's sizefact_norm column, is identical to that element's sizefact_norm vector from running fitPoisthNorm (i.e., single grouping case).  
  2.6) For a given element in groupvar, the vector of sizefact0, located in phenoData's sizefact_norm column, is identical to that element's sizefact_norm0 vector from running fitPoisthNorm (i.e., single grouping case).
