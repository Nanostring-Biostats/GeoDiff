# GeoDiff

## Overview

The GeoDiff package provides a series of statistical models using count generating distributions for fundamental tasks including background modelling, target and sample QC, normalization and differential expression analysis. The new methods are shown to be more suitable for these tasks in real examples than some conventional methods. We present GeoDiff, an R package for count generating models for analyzing Geomx RNA data, demonstrated by example data analysis pipeline vignette.


It contains the definition of the NanoStringGeoMxSet class which
inherits from Biobaseâ€™s ExpressionSet class and NanoStringRCCSet class.
