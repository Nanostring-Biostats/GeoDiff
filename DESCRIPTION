Version: 0.99.5
Authors@R: c(person("Lei", "Yang", email = "lyang@nanostring.com", role = c("aut")),

Description: A series of statistical models using count generating distributions 
    for background modelling, feature and sample QC, normalization and differential 
    expression analysis on GeoMx RNA data. The application of these methods are 
    demonstrated by example data analysis vignette.
